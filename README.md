Direct current (DC) motor plays an important role in industries. The speed of DC motor is important in the process control industries so we have to control the speed of DC motor. For this speed control proportional-integral-derivative (PID) and proportional-integral(PI) controllers are used. Here PI controller is employed to control DC motor speed and proteus is used for simulation. This report contains two parts,first part contains PI controller implemented using Opamp and second using arduino. Due to lack of information to find transfer function ,hit and trial method is used to find PI parameters
